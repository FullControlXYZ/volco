# Volco

VOLCO (VOLume COnserving) is a model capable of simulating the 3D printing process. It simulates the printing process in a voxelized space and it is capable of predicting the final shape of a 3D printed material.

- Inputs
  - gcode

- Outputs
  - `.stl` file

Example of the `.stl` file generated by VOLCO:

## Running locally

- VOLCO was tested using python `3.8`, `3.9` and `3.10`

- Installing dependencies

It is recommended to install dependencies in a virtual environment. Please, follow this guide to create a virtual environment. After the virtual environment is initialized, install the dependencies:
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

- Simulating 3D printing
```bash
python volco.py --gcode=examples/gcode_example.gcode --sim=examples/simulation_settings.json --printer=examples/printer_settings.json
```

- Running tests
```bash
pytest
```

## Running with docker-compose

- Building image
```bash
make build
```

- Simulating 3D printing inside container
```bash
make run-volco GCODE=examples/gcode_example.gcode SIM=examples/simulation_settings.json PRINTER=examples/printer_settings.json
```

- Running tests
```bash
make test
```
